## Status

* Timeline
  * 2022-11-30: Spawn time: `2022-11-30T17:00:00.000000000Z`
  * 2022-11-27: Proposal 11 voting period ends
  * 2022-11-25: Proposal 11 goes into voting period
  * 2022-11-25: Genesis file without CCV state is generated

Read the [Consumer Chain Start Process](/docs/Consumer-Chain-Start-Process.md) page for more details about the workflow.

The following items will be included in the proposal:
* Genesis file hash
  * The SHA256 is used to verify against the genesis file that the proposer has made available for review.
  * This "fresh" genesis file cannot be used to run the chain: it must be updated with the CCV states after the spawn time is reached.
* Binary hash
* Spawn time
  * Even if the proposal passes, the CCV states will not be available from the provider chain until after the spawn time is reached.

## Chain Data

### Binary

The binary published in this repo is the `popschaind` binary built using the `rooiie/popschain` repo tag [v0.1.0](https://github.com/rooiie/popschain/releases/tag/v0.1.0). You can generate the binary following the [Get Started section](https://github.com/rooiie/popschain/tree/v0.1.0#get-started).

### Verify Binary Checksum.
Binary checksums can differ based on many things to include go, libc, and make versions. To get a consistent checksum you can use something like docker to verify.

  sha256sum ~/go/bin/popschaind
  ```
  expected return `f7463cf6bcbf678709277bd5a1d94fd621ae77135e769ba0f6eb08c892c2610d`

### Genesis file

**The genesis file for Interchain Security consumer chains must include the CCV (Cross Chain Validation) state generated by the provider chain _after_ the spawn time is reached.**

Final genesis file **with CCV state**: **`pending spawn time`**
- SHA256: `pending spawn time`
- Validators must replace their `config/genesis.json` file with this one before running the binary.

The genesis file with was generated using the following settings:

* Chain ID: `popschain-1`
* Denom: `upopschain`
* Signed blocks window: `"8640"`
* Genesis file **without CCV state**: [`popschain-fresh-genesis.json`](popschain-fresh-genesis.json), SHA256: `b07ffea2e68907b277f8cc04d52ad6654d0c2a22c38d66ba5716576a52227c90`
  * **This is provided only for verification, this is not the genesis file validators should be running their nodes with.**

## Endpoints

* **p2p persistent peers : Coming Soon**
* These peers represent the `pops`validator. We are accepting `250` inbound peeers, but please consider sharing your peers in discord, or create a PR to [`peers.txt`](peers.txt)

* Please keep in mind that any validator that does not come online after 67% of the voting power is up and running, is likely to be slashed for downtime, potentially resulting in being jailed (the `signed_blocks_window` parameter is set to `8640`).

## Join via Bash Script

On the node machine:
- Copy the `node_key.json` and `priv_validator_key.json` files for your validator.
  - **These should be the same ones as the ones from your provider node**.
- Run one of the following scripts:
  - popschain service: [popschain-init.sh](popschain-init.sh)
  - Cosmovisor service: [popschain-init-cv.sh](popschain-init-cv.sh)
- Wait until the spawn time is reached and the genesis file with the CCV states is available.
- Overwrite the genesis file with the one that includes the CCV states.
  - The default location is `$HOME/.popschain/config/genesis.json`.
- Enable and start the service:
  - popschain
    ```
    sudo systemctl enable popschain
    sudo systemctl start popschain
    ```
  - Cosmovisor
    ```
    sudo systemctl enable cv-popschain
    sudo systemctl start cv-popschain
    ```
- To follow the log, use:
  - popschain: `journalctl -fu popschain`
  - Cosmovisor: `journalctl -fu cv-popschain`
- If the log does not show up right away, run `systemctl restart systemd-journald`.
